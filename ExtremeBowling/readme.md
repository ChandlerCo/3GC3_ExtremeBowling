Character class
    Physics class
        accelerate in the direction of a given vector
        return location

Camera
    get camera position

object/camera vector


display
    get objects on screen somehow


To Do:
    Chandler
        Physics should be workable
            for now floor infinite and at y =0

    Joseph:
        getter for position
            done through physics class
        
        //sweeper moves forwards and backwards
        //boomba moves left and right
    
    Sarvin:
        load objects into glut through character method and or GLUT commands in main

        
    
    Thomas:
        ball
            get position
            set acceleration
