        End menu 
            Create game over menu, victory menu (with or without high score)
            Display current score, if high score -> display this is high score

        lives and timer display
        
        menu selector
            bool mouseCallback(btn, x, y)
                return true if a menu is being displayed

            if(!mouseCallback)
                do other things like jump

        Things:
            - Glitching when mouse moved off screen 
            - Update instructions? (Include goal of game?)
            - Do we want to display anything else in end menu
